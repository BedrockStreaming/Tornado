A library for asynchronous programming in [Php](https://secure.php.net/).

*Tornado* provides several interfaces to write asynchronous programs using [generators](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.generators.php),
and adapters for [ReactPhp](https://reactphp.org/) and [Amp](https://amphp.org/).

See some examples in [`examples`](https://github.com/M6Web/Tornado/tree/master/examples) directory.
